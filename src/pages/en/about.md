The RomaJS group was **founded by [Gilles Ruppert](https://twitter.com/gillesruppert)** back in 2013.

It is a JavaScript User Group based in the city of Roma, Italia.
We discuss and have meetups about JavaScript: server-side, client-side, mobile, HTML5. Anything related JS.

**We meet every third Wednesday of the month and we coordinate the meeting using the [meetup](http://www.meetup.com/RomaJS/) platform**.
Everyone is more than welcome to come to our meeting, we ask you to RSVP just to be sure we will have enough space.

During the last years various people have helped keeping the group running:

- [Matteo Manchi](https://twitter.com/matteomanchi)

- [Luca Lanziani](https://twitter.com/lucalanziani)
